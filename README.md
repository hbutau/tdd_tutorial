##Introduction to Test Driven Development with Python Tutorial for PyConZa 2016



Test driven development is a method of programming that has been talked about considerably over the past few years. It is a way of programming that aims to achieve good quality code, by specifying your problems through writing tests first.

In my tutorial i will introduce the core concepts of TDD through creating a simple web application using Python & Django. I will explain in detail the TDD workflow. Attendees to this tutorial will be introduced to functional testing with Selenium and to unit testing with the Python Standard Library`s unittest Module.

My tutorial is aimed at beginners to Test Driven Development. I expect attendees to have some familiarity with python and Django.
